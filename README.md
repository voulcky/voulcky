- 👋 Hi, I’m @voulcky

  I've been involved in many projects as a marketer. Throughout the life I found out that I don't necessarily like marketing, and the career path isn't under my control anymore, thus I decided to change it. I've always been interested in coding and wanted to be able to create my own product myself: the only thing that's lacking is technical skills.

- 👀 I’m interested in projects, that actualy has an impact and help people live easier.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning my way into tech side of product creations. 
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on blockchain projects and/or B2B SaaS projects.
