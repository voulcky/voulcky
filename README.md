- ðŸ‘‹ As a passionate software developer and marketer from Poland, my goal is to continuously expand my skills and knowledge in the field. With experience in front-end development, sys admin, and a strong interest in machine learning and security, I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer. In addition to my technical skills, I also have a strong background in marketing and design, with expertise in UI/UX and 3D. I am driven by a desire to contribute to the growing web3 and machine learning/AI markets, and am excited to connect with like-minded individuals and contribute to innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology.
